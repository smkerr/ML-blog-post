@article{kim_convolutional_2014,
	Abstract = {We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks. We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors. The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include sentiment analysis and question classification.},

  abstract = {In this study, we examine the impact of time on state-of-the-art news veracity classifiers. We show that, as time progresses, classification performance for both unreliable and hyper-partisan news classification slowly degrade. While this degradation does happen, it happens slower than expected, illustrating that hand-crafted, content-based features, such as style of writing, are fairly robust to changes in the news cycle. We show that this small degradation can be mitigated using online learning. Last, we examine the impact of adversarial content manipulation by malicious news producers. Specifically, we test three types of attack based on changes in the input space and data availability. We show that static models are susceptible to content manipulation attacks, but online models can recover from such attacks.},

    abstract = "Continual learning (CL) aims to enable information systems to learn from a continuous data stream across time. However, it is difficult for existing deep learning architectures to learn a new task without largely forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Furthermore, CL is particularly challenging for language learning, as natural language is ambiguous: it is discrete, compositional, and its meaning is context-dependent. In this work, we look at the problem of CL through the lens of various NLP tasks. Our survey discusses major challenges in CL and current methods applied in neural network models. We also provide a critical review of the existing CL evaluation methods and datasets in NLP. Finally, we present our outlook on future research directions.",
